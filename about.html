    I am a developer and designer living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. When I'm not
    working I enjoy ultimate frisbee, music, and burritos.

    After graduating from the <a href="http://umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> (Go Blue!) with my B.S. in Computer Science, I stuck around and worked for a few years as a web developer. There, I worked on a handful of applications and mentored student developers. Iâ€™m most proud of my work on <a href="https://mprint.umich.edu" target="_blank">MPrint</a>, an application I designed and developed to allow cross-campus printing (even on mobile devices).

  <p>
    From there I moved on to Barracuda Networks to work on <a href="http://copy.com" target="_blank">Copy.com</a> and then on to <a href="http://newfoundry.com" target="_blank">NewFoundry</a>. There, I was privileged to work with some great clients (including Mitsubishi Electric, Pop-Post, and Renesas) and on some neat projects (including an Android app demo at CES 2016).

    In my free time, I play and organize a lot of ultimate frisbee. During the summers, I play on and often organize a traveling club team (most recently a mixed team named <a href="http://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/Eventteam/?TeamId=%2ftF6aaOggThpY%2bkuv2QeiTbOoV6XSuLaRJEHGZMQjKk%3d" target="_blank">Pileup</a>). I also spend a lot of time volunteering as one of five directors for <a href="http://annarborultimate.org" target="_blank">Ann Arbor Ultimate</a>, as well as designing and developing the <a href="https://github.com/a2ultimate/ultimate-league-app" target="_blank">open source league web platform</a>.
