    I'm a developer and designer living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan">Ann Arbor</a>. I
    really
    enjoy <a href="https://annarborultimate.org">ultimate frisbee</a>, <a
      href="https://music.apple.com/profile/rdonnelly">music</a>, board
    games, and travel.

    After graduating from the <a href="http://umich.edu" target="_blank">University
      of Michigan</a> (Go Blue!) with my B.S. in Computer Science, I stuck
    around and worked for a few years as a web developer. There, I mentored student developers and worked on
    a handful of applications including <a href="https://mprint.umich.edu" target="_blank">MPrint</a>,
    an application I designed and developed to allow cross-campus printing. It even included a REST API that was used by
    various student groups to make mobile applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    From there I moved on to Barracuda Networks to work on <a href="http://copy.com" target="_blank">Copy.com</a> and
    then on to <a href="http://newfoundry.com" target="_blank">NewFoundry</a>. There, I was privileged to work with
    some great clients (including Mitsubishi Electric, Pop-Post, and Renesas)
    and on some neat projects (including an Android app demo at CES 2016).
  </p>
  <p>
    I started at <a href="https://www.detroitlabs.com">Detroit Labs</a>, a digital product and services agency, in 2017
    and have been working as a lead developer and designer on a variety of projects and verticals. I have had the
    opportunity to lead work on applications for embedded in-car displays, as well as lead work on web applications
    that called for contributions to everything from UI/UX design to frontend development to backend development and
    SQL. I feel extremely privileged to be mentoring and learning from such talented people.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I play a lot of ultimate frisbee. During
    the summers, I play on (and sometimes organize) traveling club teams. I am currently an active director for <a
      href="http://annarborultimate.org" target="_blank">Ann
      Arbor Ultimate</a>, and handle designing and developing the <a
      href="https://github.com/a2ultimate/ultimate-league-app" target="_blank">open source league web platform</a>.
    Otherwise, you will find me playing board and/or card games, or maybe just building apps for them (e.g.
    <a href="/2023/10/05/mc-builder.html" target="_blank">MCBuilder</a>).
