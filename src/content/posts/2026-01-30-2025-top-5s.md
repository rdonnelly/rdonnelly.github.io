Back at it! Here are my favorite albums, movies, and television shows from 2025:

## 💿 Albums

1. El Michels Affair - 24 Hr Sports
1. Sven Wunder - Daybreak
1. Balu Brigada - Portal
1. The Circling Sun - Orbits
1. Racing Mount Pleasant - Racing Mount Pleasant

**Honorable Mention:**
*Blondshell - If You Asked For A Picture, Wednesday - Bleeds, GoGo Penguin - Necessary Fictions, Theo Croker - Dream Manifest, Matt Wilde - Find a Way, sombr - I Barely Know Her, Jack Shields & The Mojave Rush - Cherry Pick the Past*

Music was especially weird and hard to figure out this year. A lot of albums I really liked didn't stick with me over time, so these are the ones that really held up after multiple listens.

## 🍿 Movies

1. Sinners
1. One Battle After Another
1. Black Bag
1. 28 Years Later
1. Marty Supreme

**Honorable Mention:**
*Weapons, Bugonia, Warfare*

Good year for movies! I didn't see as many as I would have liked, but there were a lot of great ones in the mix. As of this writing, I still haven't seen No Other Choice, which I'm excited to check out.

## 📺 Television

1. Star Wars: Andor S2
1. The Pitt S1
1. The Rehearsal S1
1. Adolescence
1. Task S1

**Honorable Mention:**
*The Studio S1, Dept Q S1*

Television had an insane top end this year. There were so many good shows. And then kind of a drop-off (at least for what I saw). A quick turnaround for follow-up seasons would be much appreciated (The Pitt already picking up where it left off with S2!).
