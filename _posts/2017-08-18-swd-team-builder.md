This project was very much an effort to scratch a personal itch. I have been playing a game called Star Wars: Destiny for a little while and am having a really great time with it. One of the first things you need to do when playing is decide on what characters you are going to play as. Given the constraints on team building, I set out to make this a little easier and to inject some diversity.

The app revolves around selecting characters and finding matching teams for them based on various filters. As of the second set, there are almost 1800 teams, which makes for a lot of choices. Once the third set hits, I am expecting that number to probably double. It's a lot of choose from, but be able to narrow teams down by health, power, or favorite characters is a huge help.

One of the bigger features is the ability to search the popular deck building site [SWDestinyDB](http://swdestinydb.com). It adds another dimension to the app by allowing you to see if a potential team/pairing is viable, unique, or interesting.

The app is definitely not finished, I am hoping to add features and improve some interactions as time goes on. If you are interested in checking it out, [it is available on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swd-team-builder/id1238218563) for only $2.99.
