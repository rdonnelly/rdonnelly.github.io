Alright, so maybe it’s February and maybe I’ve prioritized other things ahead of getting my list of favorite albums of 2013 out…

I’m working on the list right now, but until then, here’s a list of albums I really liked from last year that didn’t quite make the cut:


- A$AP Rocky - LongLiveA$AP
- Big K.R.I.T. - King Remembered In Time
- Blood Orange - Cupid Deluxe
- CHVRCHES - The Bones of What You Believe
- Daft Punk - Random Access Memories
- The Dodos - Carrier
- Emancipator - Dusk to Dawn
- Lorde - Pure Heroine
- Killer Mike and EL-P - Run the Jewels
- Kurt Vile - Wakin On A Pretty Daze
- Pity Sex - Feast of Love
- The Shouting Matches - Grownass Man
- Surfer Blood - Pythons
- Toro Y Moi - Anything In Return
- Yelawolf - Trunk Muzik Returns


There are a few albums up there that I would have really liked to fit into my top 10, but I could not. I won’t call any out, they’re all good. Check ‘em out and let me know what you think while you wait for the top 10 list (which I hope to have out today or tomorrow).
