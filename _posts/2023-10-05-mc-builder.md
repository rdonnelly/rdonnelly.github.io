MCBuilder is a mobile and web application I made for a popular card game, [Marvel Champions](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/marvel-champions-the-card-game/), by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com). The app allows users to browse all cards in the game, complete with card text [(source)](https://github.com/zzorba/marvelsdb-json-data) and card images [(source)](https://github.com/UnicornSnuggler/Cerebro) and build decks to share.

The app is universal and utilizes [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), which allows me to easily ship code to both the App Store and the Play Store with very few code changes between the two. I then use [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) to reuse many components to allow users to view cards and decks on the web.

The web is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to make page loads extremely fast, and data for both the app and web is powered by Next.js API Routes.

One goal I had for the app is to make data and state portable, offline first, and local-only. To accomplish this, card data is synced down from the web API onto the mobile device into a SQLite database. When building decks, all data is stored in a persisted Redux store, which lives only on a user's device. Decks can be shared with other users by copying a share URL, which carries all data with it in a base64 format. The URLs can get pretty long, but that's a trade-off I made to keep all user data on-device.

Hosting and deployment is handled by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Expo's EAS](https://expo.dev/eas), which really feels like cheating sometimes. The mobile app is done using a "bare" React Native project, but if I were to start today, I would just go full Expo. There used to be some trade-off between the two paths, but now it feels like there's no question Expo is the way to go.

The game is great, and I think the app makes it nice to browse cards or theroize on a new deck build on the go! Give it a try, and as always, I'm open to feedback!
