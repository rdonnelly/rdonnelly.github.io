Alright, I know it is super late in the year
to be putting out a list for 2013, but better
late than never, right?



2013 had a lot of great music in it. I was
not sure if it could match 2012, but it
definitely did, at least in sheer volume.
At times I thought that meant it would end
up feeling a little watered down, but it
managed to avoid that fate with some really
strong stuff. Anyway, on to the list…


Disclaimer: I do not have any formal music training;
I am really just going by what I like. I am
looking for music that pulls a reaction out
of me or makes me move, not necessarily stuff
that lives up to hype, is musically sound, or
is good compared to previous work.



Hummingbird
Local Natives


Favorite Track: Black Balloons
Local Native’s Hummingbird comes out as a little more
cohesive and soothing than their strong debut album. The lead
singer’s voice can be jarring at times, but the album meshes
really well and has a really nice pace.




The 20/20 Experience Pt. 1
Justin Timberlake


Favorite Track: Don’t Hold the Wall
I like almost every song on the album, but Don’t Hold
The Wall gets me moving the most. Each song could almost
count as a double as they fade into another version of themselves,
which is a really cool concept and makes the album
both quality and long (kind of a rarity these days). Timbaland
does a really great job with the production while JT brings
it home as it showcases his vocals.

Disclaimer: This is only for the first part of 20/20. I
just could not get into the second. Maybe the 8-minute song
gimmick wore off…




Electric Lady
Janelle Monae


Favorite Track: Electric LadyElectric Lady lands outside my usual comfort zone,
but man, this is a catchy album. While Monae wraps the package
up with some great vocals and a fun theme, the funky R&B is
something I could stand to hear a little more of these days.




Settle
Disclosure


Favorite Track: When a Fire Starts to Burn
Coming in as the only true electronic album on the list,
Settle is really high energy and has a great mix
of loud, in-your-face sound	and smooth vocals.




Old
Danny Brown


Favorite Track: 25 Bucks (feat. Purity Ring)
This album feels like a split: the top half is his normal indie rap
fare while the bottom half  would feel right at home blasting
at a music festival. The whole album is great and features
some really good lyrics ranging from smart to funny to deep.
Vocally, Danny Brown takes a huge step in the right direction for
me leaving out his nasally voice (with the exception of
Wonderbread).




I Love You.
The Neighbourhood


Favorite Track: Sweater WeatherI Love You. is a really nice debut album from
The Neighbourhood. It brings a decent amount of creativity
to the pop genre. The catchy lyrics and melodies are what
hooked me.




Days Are Gone
Haim


Favorite Track: Falling
This all-female trio came out of nowhere for me.
It is fun, catchy, and upbeat. It is hard for me to
describe the music, but the harmonies and melodies are
really pleasing. Listening to this album has always
been a good time for me.




Modern Vampires of the City
Vampire Weekend


Favorite Track: Hannah Hunt
I have never been a huge fan of Vampire Weekend, but
I really like this album. Modern Vampires of the
City hits a nice level of indie for me and has a lot
of variety throughout the album to keep it interesting.




…Like Clockwork
Queens of the Stone Age


Favorite Track: Fairweather Friends
As one of the few true rock groups around, QOTSA
really put out a gem in …Like Clockwork.
They seem to have found their way for the first time since
Songs for the Deaf with a refreshing sound and
some really great guitar work. There got a bunch of great
songs, but I suggest listening to it as an album. The flow
is what really hooked me.




The Speed of Things
Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.


Favorite Track: Run
If you have talked to me about music in the last
few years, I have likely mentioned the Jr. Jr.
boys. I wasn’t sure they could follow up their 2011
debut, but man, I love “The Speed Of Things”. It
really is an indie pop/dance listeners dream with
how catchy lyrics are and how fun the melodies are.
When the album slows down, it still shines
with songs like The Haunting. Seriously,
check this out (and I challenge you to not dance
while listening).





I hope you enjoyed the list! If you get a chance, feel free
to leave me a comment, hit me up on twitter
(@rdonnelly),
or send me an email. My goal for this year is to keep this
blog up a little more and post some things that I am
listening to throughout the year. Hopefully, I will follow
through. If not, see you next year!
